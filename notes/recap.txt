- Started by doing research on what I wanted my blog to look like
- Accomplished this by looking at blogs all over the web and taking note of what features and layouts I liked from each

- Wanted to build this using a mobile first approach, so I used Kevin Powell's advice on creating the HTML for the most complicated state of the blog, being the desktop version
- Once I finished writing the HTML, I focused on styling general aspects of the blog, not focusing on responsiveness yet
